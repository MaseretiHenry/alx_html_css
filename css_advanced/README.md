# HTML & CSS Advanced Project: Smiles School

## Overview

This project is a continuation of the HTML advanced concept, focusing specifically on **CSS and the visual styling** of a webpage based on a provided Figma design. The goal is to transform a basic HTML structure into a visually appealing and responsive web page, demonstrating strong understanding of CSS principles and attention to design details.

## Project Structure

The project is organized as follows:

* **`alx_html_css/`**: The main repository directory.
    * **`css_advanced/`**: This directory contains the core files for this project.
        * **`README.md`**: This file, providing an overview of the project.
        * **`index.html`**: The main HTML file, structured to accommodate the provided design.
        * **`style.css`**: (To be created) This will be the stylesheet that brings the Figma design to life.
        * **`images/`**: A directory containing all the necessary image assets for the project.

## Objectives

This project aims to achieve the following learning objectives:

* **HTML Structure Refinement**: Adapt and refine the provided HTML structure to precisely match the Figma design, ensuring semantic correctness and accessibility.
* **CSS Styling**: Apply advanced CSS techniques to style the `index.html` page, including but not limited to:
    * **Layout and Positioning**: Utilize Flexbox and/or Grid for robust and responsive layouts.
    * **Typography**: Implement custom fonts (Source Sans Pro, Spin Cycle OT), font sizes, weights, and line heights as specified in Figma.
    * **Color Palette**: Accurately apply colors from the design to various elements.
    * **Spacing and Sizing**: Ensure correct margins, padding, and element dimensions.
    * **Responsiveness**: Implement media queries to ensure the design adapts gracefully to different screen sizes (mobile, tablet, desktop).
    * **Interactive Elements**: Style buttons, navigation links, and other interactive elements to match the design's hover and active states.
* **Figma Proficiency**: Develop the ability to extract design specifications (colors, fonts, dimensions, spacing, assets) directly from a Figma design file.
* **Image Integration**: Properly integrate and optimize images for the web, using appropriate `src` and `alt` attributes.
* **Font Awesome Integration**: Correctly use Font Awesome for icons as depicted in the design.
* **Code Quality**: Write clean, well-organized, and commented HTML and CSS code.

## Design Reference

The design for this project is available on Figma:

* [**Smiles School Page in Figma**](https://www.figma.com/file/a4d3P59bZ0P9t22m6r93oO/smileschool-styleguide) (You may need to create a Figma account and "Duplicate to your Drafts" to access all design details.)

**Important Notes for Design Implementation:**

* **Fonts**: The project utilizes `Source Sans Pro` and `Spin Cycle OT`. If these fonts are not installed on your system, you can download them from:
    * [Source Sans Pro](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Source+Sans+Pro)
    * [Spin Cycle OT](https://www.fonts.com/font/typodermic/spin-cycle/ot) (Please note: finding a free and direct download link for Spin Cycle OT might require some searching or using Google Fonts equivalents if a direct link is not readily available or allowed for this context).
* **Measurements**: Some values in Figma may be in floating-point numbers. Feel free to round these to the nearest whole number or a sensible decimal value for CSS implementation.

## How to View the Project

To view this project locally:

1.  **Clone the repository** (if you haven't already):
    ```bash
    git clone [https://github.com/your-username/alx_html_css.git](https://github.com/your-username/alx_html_css.git)
    ```
    (Replace `your-username` with your actual GitHub username.)
2.  **Navigate to the project directory**:
    ```bash
    cd alx_html_css/css_advanced
    ```
3.  **Open `index.html`** in your preferred web browser. You can usually do this by double-clicking the file or by running `xdg-open index.html` (on Linux) or `open index.html` (on macOS) in your terminal.

## Next Steps (Styling)

The current `index.html` provides the basic structure. The next phase involves creating a `style.css` file and applying all the necessary CSS to match the Figma design precisely. This will include:

* Defining custom properties (variables) for colors and fonts.
* Implementing a mobile-first approach to responsiveness.
* Styling each section and element according to the design guidelines.

Feel free to open issues or contribute to this project if you find areas for improvement!
